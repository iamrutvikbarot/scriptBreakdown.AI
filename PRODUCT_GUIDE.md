# SCRIPTBREAKDOWN.AI - User Guide & Integration Guide

Welcome to **ScriptBreakdown.AI**, the professional-grade tool for transforming your raw screenplays into structured, production-ready data.

## 🚀 How to Use the Service

### 1. Prepare your Google Doc
Our service integrates directly with Google Docs for automated analysis and annotation. 
- **Share Permission**: You must share your Google Doc with our service account email:
  `breakdown-ai@brack-down-ai.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Access Level**: Set the permission to **Editor**. This allows the AI to highlight entities directly in your script.

### 2. Character Definition Pattern (IMPORTANT)
For the most accurate cast extraction, our AI uses an embedded pattern detection. In your action paragraphs, introduce characters using the following format:
`NAME (Sex) (Age) (Build) (Wardrobe)`

**Example:**
> *INT. - AIRPLANE - DAY*
> 
> **APRIL (F) (30s) (Kind and smart) (Nice clothes)** sits next to **PAUL (M) (30s) (Big, strong, toxic) (Casual clothes)**. PAUL is aggressive and takes up space.

### 3. Run the Breakdown
- Copy your Google Doc URL.
- Paste it into the input field on the **ScriptBreakdown.AI** home page.
- Click **"BREAK IT DOWN"**.
- Watch the progress bar as the AI processes each scene in real-time.

### 4. Review Results
- **In-App**: View the structured breakdown including summaries, cast details, props, vehicles, and effects (SFX/VFX).
- **In-Doc**: Return to your Google Doc to see automated color-coded highlights of all extracted entities.
